# clientServerTLS
This repository contains a raw implementation of TLS Handshake protocol. 
It shows how TLS handshake proceeds and what are the four different phases in it and steps taken by the client and server in each on these phases.
The client and server get their respective keys certified from the Trusted third party and then begin the TLS Handshake.
